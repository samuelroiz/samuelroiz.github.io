		<p> &emsp; I enjoy going to Disneyland and collecting pins. I currently collect pins related to Sven and Kristoff from Frozen. I also collect Stitch as a pirate from Pirates of the Caribbean. I not only gather, but I also have a small business in the Disney community. The firm is for Disney pick-ups for customers that want pins, merchandise, and clothes.   </p>
