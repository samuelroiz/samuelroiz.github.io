		<p> &emsp; I started playing rugby as a child that was introduced to the sport by an Irish family in the bay area. I played through high school and college as I became the CSUN Men's rugby president for CSUN. My favorite rugby team is the IRFU and the Brave Blossoms.

		<p align="left"> &emsp; I began my CrossFit career in 2009 at the Cave located in <b>Northern California</b>. In my early years, I took courses in gymnastics and parkour before joining the CrossFit community.
		
&emsp; After years of training as an athlete, I earned my CrossFit <b>Level 1 Certification</b> in 2016, with a specialization in <b>Olympic Weightlifting</b>, and began my coaching career. I have been a member of the CrossFit community since the beginning of CrossFit and my passion for fitness drives me to continue inspiring members to achieve their gym goals. Through my years of experience and training, I continue to share his knowledge and expertise with our hearing and non-hearing members as he is also proficient in <b>American Sign Language</b>.

		<p> &emsp; I enjoy going to Disneyland and collecting pins. I currently collect pins related to Sven and Kristoff from Frozen. I also collect Stitch as a pirate from Pirates of the Caribbean. I not only gather, but I also have a small business in the Disney community. The firm is for Disney pick-ups for customers that want pins, merchandise, and clothes. </p>
